# unit-4-game

A browser-based jQuery game where the player has to guess select numerical values randomly assigned to pictures of crystals so that they add up to the randomly set target number

## Project Motivation

This game was developed as part of an introductory jQuery homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is a testament to the mastery of fundamental jQuery concepts that resulted in a game that is simple yet powerful and fun to play. It also goes to show how the jQuery library can be leveraged over vanilla JavaScript to create a reasonably complicated game with only a few lines of code.

## Getting Started

Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine and open index.html using a browser. When the page loads up, the game will start and you start making guesses!

## Getting Help
